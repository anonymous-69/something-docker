<p><em><b>Disclaimer:</b> First, let me get this out of the way. I am not an accountant, tax adviser or anything in the like. I&#8217;m a normal guy that who thinks cryptocurrency will ultimately crash.</em><em>I am not saying, it's a bad a bad idea to invest in crypto, that&#8217;s totally up to you! This post is for the people who believe &#8220;<strong>cryptocurrency will be the future</strong>&#8220;.</em></p>
<p>With all the buzz around cryptocurrency and VCs mindlessly funding any startup that claims to have a new cryptocurrency reminds me of the  <strong>dot-com bubble </strong>in the early twenties<b>. </b>Investors were so excited about the progress of the internet that they stopped caring about whether the company was profitable or not. Or at least could have become profitable in future.<b> </b>Even for a person like me, who believes it will crash, it i means thas really hard to not think about investing in it, especially when its value has increased significantly over the past year.</p>
<p><em><strong>In this post, I will give you a solid reason why it will fail. I promise there will be no bullsh*t speculation, but a complete and utter logic. </strong></em></p>

<h2>Why will it ultimately fail?</h2>
<p>If we look specifically at bitcoin, we know that there are 21 million bitcoins that will be mined. And this makes sense, if something is in limited quantity, its value will rise as more and more people buy it. But what most of the people fail to understand is that bitcoin is <strong>not the only cryptocurrency</strong> in the market. There is a lot of them. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This website</a> shows the list of some popular cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Let me explain you by giving a simple example</strong></em> &#8211; For cryptocurrency to be the future, it means that most of the developed countries would have legalised it and hence it is somewhat a currency in which you perform your daily purchases and investment. Another thing you guys have to agree with me is that there will be 3-4 cryptocurrencies that will rule the market. For our ease, let us take the number of major cryptocurrencies to be three.</p>
<p>Now think of cryptocurrency as a gold. If the above scenario were to happen, it would  mean that we would have thrice the amount of the actual gold that it present on the earth. Some of it is mined and some are yet to be mined. The value of gold then will become one third of its actual value.</p>
<p><strong>Just to put things a perspective:</strong> According to <a href="https://money.howstuffworks.com/how-much-money-is-in-the-world.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this website,</a> there are $1.2 trillion in the world. Let us assume that the countries which will not legalise it accounts for $0.2 trillion( <strong>Numbers don&#8217;t really have a big role to play,  lets focus on the concept. )</strong>Now $1 trillion will be divided into three cryptocurrencies, <strong>hence dipping the value of the currency by freaking one third. How on earth can this be future?</strong> Cryptocurrencies will crash long before something like this is close to happen.</p>
<br><p>Before writing this post, I was discussing it with my friends who have invested in some cryptocurrency, and one of the argument that they presented was: <strong>It&#8217;s NOT easy to mine these coins, and the difficulty level increases as more and more coins are being mined.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I completely agree with that, but the thing is, even though the coins take a lot of computing power, they are still abundant. And if cryptocurrency were to be the future, then 33% of all currencies(considering, we took number of  major currencies that survive are 3) will make 100% of the world&#8217;s currency.  And mining 33% from every currency  will not be consuming that much resources. We have actually mined more than 33% of most of the coins.</p>
<h2>Why is everyone going towards Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<p>After the 2008 Financial crises, people lost their faith in Federal Reserve.<strong> As the result of this, they  struggled for a shoulder on which they could rely on and they saw bitcoin as a reliable currency on which they could place their bets on. And it was kinda perfect!</strong></p>
<p>For the first time, it was people who ruled the currency and not some authority and it was decentralised, it even solved the problem of double spending and <strong>most importantly, you didn&#8217;t had to rely on someone, the system was itself transparent.</strong> But the addition of other cryptocurrencies just ruined it for the above mentioned reason.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why people always look at it for short sightly. When you break up, it&#8217;s tempting to find someone with whom you bitch about your ex, but we all know how bad that ends ups being!</p>
<p>At the end I would like to clear out, that I am not trying to discourage you to invest in cryptocurrency, I am just sharing an opinion on why it will crash ultimately. Obviously, it&#8217;s a controversial topic, and I would love to hear what you guys think. Rush down to the comment section and speak up your mind.</p>
peace!
