<i><b>Disclaimer :</b>I am not discouraging anyone to root their phones. I am just presenting you my view point on why rooting has become unpopular. </i>
<br>
<br>
In in the recent years, there have been a decline in the users rooting there phones. And here is the list of things that I believe, has led to this decline -
Do note that they are not in any specific order. 

<ol>
<li><b>High performing SoC –</b>Back in the days, the SoC were not that powerful to play intensive games like Asphalt 8 or Nova 3. Some of them which played lagged a lot and sometimes even crash. Back then, overclocking processors to grab every bit of power left was a big deal.
But now the times has changed, even a $150 smartphones lets you play intensive games without much noticeable lag. </li>

<li><b>Increase in battery capacity –</b>The battery life of the smartphones have increased (not you iPhone!). Back then, if a phone had 3000 mAh it was a big deal, but now almost all the phones launched in 2017 have more that 3000 mAh battery capacity. </li>

<li><b>Increase in storage capacity –</b>There was a time when the phones came 800 MB of storage, when the android phones just came to existence, but we are not traveling that roads.
Lets talk about the time, when there were phone that came with 8 GB or 4GB of internal storage. And the usable space was like 2.5 GB and 5 GB respectively. People craved to install apps on SD card, which most of the manufactures denied. Hence rooting your device was the only way to go.  </li>

<li><b>Heavy and sluggish user interface ( UI ) -</b>Back then, the companies used to put very terrible skins on their devices which disrupted the overall user experience of the phones. But most manufacturers have improved a lot recently, specially Samsung. I believe that was the primary reason, why people has stopped experimenting with their phones <br>
Take my example, when I rooted my phone, it was only because wanted to get rid of the sluggish UI by install a custom ROM. </li> 
</ol>
<br><br>
<p><i>There will surely be other reasons, why rooting has lost its popularity over the years. Lets meet in the comment section below and discuss more about this. As this is a very open ended topic, I would love to red what you guys think about. <br>
