<h1>Which Distribution should you do with after using Ubuntu or Mint? </h1>

<p>This is the question many folks come up with after they have used a particular Linux distribution for a while. And usually, people begin with Debian based distribution like Ubuntu and Mint. And that in my opinion, it is a pretty good distribution to begin with because at that time, you don't know much and once you are stuck, you either spend a lot of time googling about it (which is pretty awesome thing to do as you learn a lot!) or just quit using it and hate Linux for rest of your life. Even setting up a distribution like Debian takes hell lot of time. Finding the drivers is a real pain in the ass and that might freak out some beginners. Both Mint and Ubuntu are quite good. I won't recommend using it for long. Plus there Ubuntu and mint are not stable as compared to Debian, Arch and its derivative. At the time of writing this article,<b> " suspend mode "</b> didn't work as it should on laptops and the users have to force reboot it. Many users reported it on the Ubuntu forums and actually, this was the major reason that I switched to Debian.</p>

<p>Now when you are familiar with the terminal, you might find yourself liking one of the below categories. </p>

	<h2> Bleeding-Edge Linux Distribution</h2>



<br>
<p>Bleeding edge refers to technology that has been released but is still not ready for the general public as it has not been reliably tested. This risk could take the form of limited support, uncaught problems and compatibility issues.</p>

<p>These people unlike many are willing to risk stability for the sake of new technology. I would like to call these people as <b>" Linux enthusiast "</b> as unlike others they use willing to try no matter the consequences. If you are among them then these are the Linux distribution, you can check out - </p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Debian Sid </b></li>
<li> <b>Gentoo unstable</b> </li>
<li><b>Arch Linux </b></li>
<li><b> Fedora Rawhide </b></li>
<li><b> OpenSUSE Tumbleweed </b></li>
  </ul>
<br>
                    <h2>Stable Distribution </h2>

<p>This is the distribution for the people who like the <b>stability.</b> They just want to get the work done. They generally use it for programming and these are also used for the server purpose as it won't crash and it won't need a reboot. If you are one of them you can have a look at these - </p>
<ul>
<li>Debian </li>
<li> Arch Linux </li>
<li> CentOS </li>
</ul>
<p>Debian and Arch Linux are popular for the high quality control.<br> 
Coming from Mint or Ubuntu, Debian has a small learning curve. Setting up Arch for a beginner looks scary as hell, as you don't have that colorful menu when you start installing it, you have to use the command line. But that's actually the beauty of Arch, you get to setup up your own OS. Both Arch and CentOS will be having some different commands as compared to Debian based distribution. To know more about the Linux distribution.</p>



                            <h2> Hacking and Penetration Testing  Distributions </h2>
<p>I believe its loud and clear, what type of people does this category attract. These distributions have a lot of tools which are really useful from hacking point of view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kali Linux </li>
<li>Parrot Security OS </li>
<li>Pentoo Linux </li>
</ul><br>
<p>You would be better of with Kali instead of Parrot as Parrot is relatively new and it is quite unstable. Both are Debian bases distributions thought. Both Parrot OS and Kali Linux are Debian based, whereas Pentoo Linux is Arch based.</p>
<br>
<p>
But I wouldn’t recommend using them as your primary distribution because you are logged in as root which is never recommended for long periods. Specifically when you don’t need the superuser permission.<a href= "{{ url_for('Should_You_Install_Kali_Linux_as_a_Beginner') }}"> I have talked in depth about this  here </a> </p><br>

<h2>Learning Curve in Moving From One Distribution to Another</h2>

<p>This picture clearly depicts the learning curve going from one Distribution to another the Ubuntu being the most simplistic and Linux from Scratch being a distributions which is really hard to master in.</p>
